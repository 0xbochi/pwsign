The pwsign script is a PowerShell script for digitally signing executable files using a certificate. It supports digital signing of individual files as well as signing all files in a folder and its subfolders recursively. Installation

To use the pwsign script, you must have PowerShell installed on your computer. The script does not require any additional installation.

=> Usage 
* -s or --sign: Specifies the file or folder to digitally sign.
* -r or --recursive: Specifies that the digital signature should be applied to all files in a folder and its subfolders.
* -c or --certificate: Specifies the name of the certificate to use to sign the file or folder. If this parameter is not specified, the script uses the default certificate "certificate.pfx".
* -d or --doc: Displays the script documentation.
* -v or --version : Displays the version of the script.
* -g or --generate : Generate a new certificate.
* -i or --import: Imports a certificate.
* -p or --path: Specifies the path to save or import the certificate.
* -a or --authority: Specifies the certificate authority to use for importing the certificate. If this parameter is not specified, the script uses the "Cert:\LocalMachine\Root" certificate authority by default.

=> Use it by default 

* Generate and export your certificat
./main.ps1 -g

* Import your certificate
./main.ps1 -i 

* Sign your script folder recursively
./main.ps1 -s -p "C:Path\to\your\folder" -r 

or sign only one file
./main.ps1 -s -p "C:Path\to\your\folder\script.ps1"

Done :)
